        <h1>The Basic Stuff</h1>
        <h3>I will update this site overtime as we go and time allows. There is no shortage of info on C# and HTML/CSS  Please exuse any spelling and grammar errors, I will fix them as time allows as well. All links will open in a new window. Any questions, comments, and/or suggestions please feel free to let me know.</h3>  

        <p>
            If you you have't done so go ahead and do the basic <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/hello-world-tutorial/intro" target="blank">"Hello World" code from Microsoft:</a> This will only take you about 10 mins to complete, if that. It will give you a good idea of what we are about to start. </p>
            <div class = box1>
        <ul>
            <li>We will need to install <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/" target="blank">Visual Studio IDE (Community 2019) and Visual Studio Code:</a> Community will be used for our C# coding, and Studio will be used for our HTML/CSS coding.  <img src="assets/Capture.JPG" width= "250" height= "125"> </li>
            <br />
            <li>There was pre-work given to the people taking the course. It can be found <a href="https://eleven-fifty-academy.gitbook.io/dotnet-100-prework-gitbook/" target="blank">here.</a> (Please note this is the outdated version as current version is only accessible through Canvas.)This covers HTML/CSS and C# basics. I found the HTML/CSS stuff to be helpful, however the C# stuff was vague and frustrating. So I am not sure how much we will refer to it. (Example: The Variables code is wrong, and won't work. I pointed this out to the instructor and he said he will fix it for future versions.) </li>
            <br />
            <li>I would like to use the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/csharp-tutorial-for-beginners/" target="blank">C# Basics course from Mosh on Udemy.</a> The course is often on sale (as of writing this it is on sale for $20) and does a good job explaining the basics of C# is, what it does, and the basics of coding. If you don't want to spend the money on the course that's fine there are plenty of free resources out there. </li>
            <br />
            <li>This video is a great resource and something I want to use (plus it is free) it was recommended by the academy and people in the course used it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sQurwqK0JNE" target ="blank">C# Fundamentals for Absolute Beginners From Bob Tabor</a></li>
            <br />
            <li>I would like to use the gitbook Prework for the HTML/CSS work. However it is basic and the pages you need to build for the course FAR exceed what it teaches you. So there are these free courses from Code Academy <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html" target= "blank">HTML</a> and <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css" target = "blank">CSS.</a> I have not had a chance to look at these courses, but will utilize these during this process.</li>

        <h2>Apps</h2>
        <div class=appbox>
            <p>There are plenty of apps to help us along the journey, while none of these are needed for the class; (one will be used for the assesment if you choose to apply for the course) I found to have something quick to have on your phone to review helps. (all these apps are for apple and android)

                <h4>Grasshoper</h4>
                <p>Grasshopper is the app that is used for the assesment when you apply. It teaches you Java Script; this is a good app to learn some basics and learn to think logically with coding. For the assesment you will need to complete the first "Fundamentals" portion. It does take a while but I found it to be fun. plus if you screw up a lot you can always clear out your progress and start over.</p>

                <h4>Quizlet</h4>
            <p>Quizlet is a fantastic app for flashcards. There some good card sets for C# <a href="http://https://quizlet.com/3035144/intro-to-c-flash-cards/" target="blank">here</a> and <a href="https://quizlet.com/12649697/c-programming-flash-cards/"target="blank">here</a>
